# SimplePhoneCall Plugin

SimplePhoneCall is a Minecraft plugin that brings voice call functionality to your server using the Simple Voice Chat API. With this plugin, players can initiate private voice calls, answer incoming calls, decline unwanted calls, and hang up when they're done ‚Äì just like in real life!
